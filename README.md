# 🌾 Agro-Shield

> **Protecting Every Harvest. Connecting Every Farmer.**

Agro-Shield is a digital agriculture platform designed to reduce post-harvest losses, improve market access, and empower farmers across Idoma communities and beyond.

Built for the **Idoma Centenary Plus Hackathon 2026**, the platform addresses one of Benue State's biggest agricultural challenges: helping farmers store, manage, and sell their produce at fair market prices while providing access to intelligent farming assistance.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

Benue State is one of Nigeria's largest producers of agricultural products, yet many farmers continue to experience:

- High post-harvest losses
- Poor access to verified buyers
- Unstable market prices
- Limited storage management
- Lack of modern digital farming tools
- Poor access to agricultural information

Many smallholder farmers are forced to sell immediately after harvest at very low prices because they lack information and access to larger markets.

**Agro-Shield aims to bridge this gap.**

# 🗄️ Database Architecture

Agro-Shield initially used **SQLite** because it was lightweight and suitable for rapid MVP development and local testing.

As the platform moves toward multi-user and production deployment, we are migrating to **PostgreSQL**.

### Why PostgreSQL?

The migration is intended to provide:

- Better support for concurrent users
- Stronger transactional capabilities
- Improved data integrity
- Better scalability
- Production and cloud deployment readiness
- A stronger foundation for the future marketplace
- Better support for larger farmer, buyer, and transaction datasets

### Current Database Evolution

#### Initial MVP

```text
Go Application

Repository Layer
      │
      ▼
SQLite
```

### Target Architecture

```text
Frontend
    │
    ▼
Go HTTP Server
    │
    ▼
Handlers
    │
    ▼
Service Layer
    │
    ▼
Repository Layer
    │
    ▼
PostgreSQL
```

The repository pattern allows the database layer to evolve without requiring major changes to the application's business logic.

### PostgreSQL Migration Plan

The migration is being implemented in stages:

1. Set up the PostgreSQL development database.
2. Create PostgreSQL-compatible migrations.
3. Update the Go database connection layer.
4. Replace SQLite-specific database configuration and queries where required.
5. Update repositories and data-access components.
6. Test registration and authentication flows.
7. Test marketplace and future transaction workflows.
8. Configure production database deployment.
9. Remove the SQLite dependency after PostgreSQL integration has been fully validated.

> **Current Status:** PostgreSQL migration is in progress. SQLite remains part of the project's initial MVP development history.
